## Documentation and community

PushType can be used in production projects now (we’ve been using it on client sites since the beginning of 2015). So give it a go - get started by finding out [how to install PushType](http://www.pushtype.org/docs/installation) and understanding the [key concepts](http://www.pushtype.org/docs/key-concepts).

Central to the PushType mission is an active and healthy [developer community](https://discuss.pushtype.org/). Help us to find bugs, identify the pain points and suggest features that will make PushType work better for you.
